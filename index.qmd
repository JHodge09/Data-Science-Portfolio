Hi,

My name is Jeremy Hodge. I'm a data analyst that has been in the healthcare industry for almost a decade. In my line of work I specialize in Excel, SQL, and data cleansing.

Below is a link to my resume.

For the topic of the blog, I would like to discuss Random Forest. This method is valuable due to high accuracy, mitigating over fitting, detecting outliers, and handling missing values. Below, I provided some of the code used with Random Forest.

\# Train the random forest model with default parameters

rf_default \<- randomForest(hlth \~ ., data = OFP_train)

In conclusion, Random Forest is useful for being able to create accurate predictions, reducing overfitting, and dealing with missing data, this makes Random Forest a valuable tool in machine learning.
